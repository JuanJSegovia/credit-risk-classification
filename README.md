# Creditworthiness Classification with Logistic Regression

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to develop and evaluate a supervised machine learning model that predicts the creditworthiness of borrowers. Specifically, the model aims to classify borrowers into two categories:

Healthy borrowers (Label 0): Borrowers likely to repay loans without issues.
High-risk borrowers (Label 1): Borrowers with a higher likelihood of defaulting.
By accurately predicting high-risk borrowers, the company can minimize financial risks and optimize lending decisions.
The dependent y variable used to make predictions was the loan_status, the independent variables were all the other columns. The dependent and independent variables were then slpit into training and testing datasets. A logistic regeression model was then utitlized using the training data, and predictions were made.

## Results
The logistic regression model was evaluated using a test dataset, and the following performance metrics were observed:

### Accuracy Score: 99%
The model correctly classified 99% of the borrowers overall.

### Precision Score:

Healthy borrowers (Label 0): 99%
99% of borrowers predicted as healthy were actually healthy.
High-risk borrowers (Label 1): 94%
94% of borrowers predicted as high-risk were actually high-risk.

### Recall Score:

Healthy borrowers (Label 0): 100%
Almost all healthy borrowers were correctly identified.
High-risk borrowers (Label 1): 84%
The model identified 84% of high-risk borrowers correctly but missed 16%.
Summary
The logistic regression model demonstrated excellent performance in predicting healthy borrowers and good performance in identifying high-risk borrowers. 

# Analysis of its strengths and limitations of the model:

### Strengths:
High Accuracy: The model's 99% accuracy indicates strong overall performance.
Reliability for Healthy Borrowers: Near-perfect recall (100%) and high precision (99%) for healthy borrowers ensure minimal misclassification of low-risk customers.
Good Precision for High-Risk Borrowers: The model is effective at identifying high-risk borrowers, with 94% precision.
### Limitations:
Recall for High-Risk Borrowers: The recall for high-risk borrowers is 84%, meaning the model misses 16% of true high-risk borrowers. This could lead to possible financial risks if these borrowers are incorrectly classified as healthy.

## Recommendation:
The model is great at recognizing low-risk (healthy) borrowers but could use a bit more fine-tuning to catch all the high-risk borrowers without misclassifying too many healthy ones. I believe that this logistic regression model is a strong candidate for deployment, especially if the company prioritizes minimizing false positives (erroneously classifying healthy borrowers as high-risk). However, if minimizing false negatives (missing high-risk borrowers) is critical, further model improvements are recommended. 
In conclusion, this logistic regression model provides a reliable baseline for borrower classification, with room for optimization tailored to the companyâ€™s risk tolerance and objectives.
